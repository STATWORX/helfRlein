\usage{
get_files(dir, pattern = "", suffix = ".R$")
}
\arguments{
\item{dir}{A character string that defines the root directory within which
all R files will be analysed}

\item{pattern}{A character string containing a regular expression to be
matched in all R files found in the specified directory}

\item{suffix}{A string with a pattern to filter the searched file endings.
The default is ".R$" to only look for R-files. Use "." to search all files.}
}
\value{
Returns a character vector containing all files that match the
  pattern
}
\description{
\code{get_files} searches for matches to argument \code{pattern}
  within each R file that is a descendant of parent directory \code{dir}. It
  works like a global find function that returns all R files within
  \code{dir} that match \code{pattern}. Be careful not to choose a parent
  directory has too many subdirectories and files.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Find all files in . that load packages through library
get_files(dir = ".", pattern = "library")
}
